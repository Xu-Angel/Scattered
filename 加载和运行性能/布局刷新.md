Using requestIdleCallback

Many sites and apps have a lot of scripts to execute. Your JavaScript often needs to be run as soon as possible, but at the same time you don’t want it to get in the user’s way. If you send analytics data when the user is scrolling the page, or you append elements to the DOM while they happen to be tapping on the button, your web app can become unresponsive, resulting in a poor user experience.

Using requestIdleCallback to schedule non-essential work

The good news is that there’s now an API that can help: requestIdleCallback. In the same way that adopting requestAnimationFrame allowed us to schedule animations properly and maximize our chances of hitting 60fps, requestIdleCallback will schedule work when there is free time at the end of a frame, or when the user is inactive. This means that there’s an opportunity to do your work without getting in the user’s way. It’s available as of Chrome 47, so you can give it a whirl today by using Chrome Canary! It is an experimental feature, and the spec is still in flux, so things could change in the future.

Why should I use requestIdleCallback?
Scheduling non-essential work yourself is very difficult to do. It’s impossible to figure out exactly how much frame time remains because after requestAnimationFrame callbacks execute there are style calculations, layout, paint, and other browser internals that need to run. A home-rolled solution can’t account for any of those. In order to be sure that a user isn’t interacting in some way you would also need to attach listeners to every kind of interaction event (scroll, touch, click), even if you don’t need them for functionality, just so that you can be absolutely sure that the user isn’t interacting. The browser, on the other hand, knows exactly how much time is available at the end of the frame, and if the user is interacting, and so through requestIdleCallback we gain an API that allows us to make use of any spare time in the most efficient way possible.

Let’s take a look at it in a little more detail and see how we can make use of it.

Checking for requestIdleCallback
It’s early days for requestIdleCallback, so before using it you should check that it’s available for use:

if ('requestIdleCallback' in window) {
  // Use requestIdleCallback to schedule work.
} else {
  // Do what you’d do today.
}
You can also shim its behavior, which requires falling back to setTimeout:

window.requestIdleCallback =
  window.requestIdleCallback ||
  function (cb) {
    var start = Date.now();
    return setTimeout(function () {
      cb({
        didTimeout: false,
        timeRemaining: function () {
          return Math.max(0, 50 - (Date.now() - start));
        }
      });
    }, 1);
  }

window.cancelIdleCallback =
  window.cancelIdleCallback ||
  function (id) {
    clearTimeout(id);
  }
```
